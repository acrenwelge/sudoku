## Sudoku App
This is a JavaScript-powered app I built to generate and solve sudoku boards. You can go
[play around with it](https://acrenwelge.github.io/sudoku) or
[check out how I built it](https://acrenwelge.github.io/game/2017/04/05/sudoku.html).

I included lots of cool features:
* You can adjust the difficulty level from super easy all the way to impossibly hard
* Start a new game, pause, reset, or solve the puzzle at any time
* The board is hidden when the game is paused
* A timer shows you how long it took you to solve the puzzle
* Click on a cell and use arrow keys to navigate the board
* Use your keyboard to input a number or use the number bar at the bottom
* Get instant feedback (green/red highlighting) about your input
* Use `delete` or `backspace` to clear a cell
